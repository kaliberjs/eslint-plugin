# Problem
The `no-new-object` rule has been deprecated and its successor, `no-object-constructor`, is not available in the current ESLint version.

See: https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/no-new-object

# Attempts
No attempts were made to fix this test, as the rule is deprecated and its successor is not available.

# Possible Solution
The test should remain skipped.
