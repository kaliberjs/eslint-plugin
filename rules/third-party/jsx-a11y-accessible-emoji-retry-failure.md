# Problem
The `jsx-a11y/accessible-emoji` rule is deprecated and has been removed from later versions of the `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` package.

# Attempts
No attempts were made to fix this test, as the rule no longer exists.

# Possible Solution
There is no solution, as the rule is deprecated. The test should remain skipped.
